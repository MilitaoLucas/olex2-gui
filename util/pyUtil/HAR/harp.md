# Hirshfeld Atom Refinement
The <b>H</b>irshfeld <b>A</b>tom <b>R</b>efinement employs aspherical atomic scattering factors calculated from a theoretical density. This approach allows for an accurate localization of hydrogen atoms, an accurate determination of non-hydrogen ADPs and an anisotropic refinement of hydrogen atoms.
Since the re-implementation of HAR inside NoSpherA2 this tool was removed.
