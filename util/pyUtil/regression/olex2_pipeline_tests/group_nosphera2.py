"""NoSpherA2, across the backends that produce form factors.

Each backend gets the same shape of test: refine spherically for a baseline,
then run **one** aspherical refinement and check that R1 moved and did not get
worse. A tsc that is produced but never reaches the refinement looks identical
to one that works, and the R1 is the only thing that tells them apart.

The aspherical run is a plain `spy.refine.do_refine`, not a hand-built
sequence. With `use_aspherical` set and olex2.refine selected,
RunRefinementPrg hands the whole thing to `aaff.deal_with_AAFF`, which is the
production HAR workflow: it sets the hydrogen treatment, calls
`NoSpherA2_instance.launch()`, requires a table to appear, resolves the table's
columns against the model, validates the table's hash and origin, refines, and
loops on the shifts until it converges or hits Max_HAR_Cycles.

Driving that instead of orchestrating the steps here is the point of these
tests. It covers the parts of the pipeline a hand-built sequence skips
entirely - the hash and origin checks, the scatterer resolution, the
convergence loop - and it means disorder is handled the way it is in
production, by one call that hands every part's wavefunction to `-mtc`, rather
than by this file deciding how parts should be combined.

`deal_with_AAFF` keeps its own record in `<name>.NoSpherA2`, a line per cycle
with R1 and wR2, so that file existing with a cycle in it is the evidence the
workflow ran rather than being skipped.

The quantum backends are minutes to hours, so they are behind OLEX2_TEST_FULL.
discamb is a databank and SALTED a trained model, so both are quick.

A backend that is not offered here is SKIPped by name, with the list that was
offered. It is never dropped silently: this suite exists to say what was
covered, and "no ORCA here" is a different statement from "ORCA works".
