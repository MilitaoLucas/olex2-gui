"""End-to-end tests that run inside Olex2, with nothing stubbed.

The suite in the parent directory uses dummy olx/olex modules, so it can only
reach code that does not touch a structure. Everything that matters about
Olex2 - loading a model, running a macro, solving, refining, generating form
factors - needs the real thing behind it. This runs inside olex2c, which is
Olex2 without a window, so `olx`, `spy` and the macro layer are genuine.

  <olex2c> -b <rundir> pipeline.olx

where pipeline.olx is a single line:

  py.Run '<this directory>/pipeline_tests.py'

Selecting what to run, by environment variable, since py.Run takes no
arguments of its own:

  OLEX2_TEST_GROUPS   comma separated: macros, solve, refine, nosphera2
                      default: macros,solve,refine
  OLEX2_TEST_FULL     1 to include the slow quantum backends
  OLEX2_TEST_OUT      where to write the result table

Every case reports PASS, FAIL or SKIP with a reason. A backend that is not
installed is a SKIP and says so - it is never silently dropped, because a
suite that quietly tests nothing looks exactly like a suite that passes.
