# Rotate 
Using this tool, you can control the rotation of the molecule on the screen in a somewhat more fine-grained and repeatable way compared to what can be achieved with the mouse. 

## Rotate around the axis x, y and z 
Enter the degrees of rotation into the spin boxes, then press the buttons to rotate either in the negative or positive direction. 

## Even finer control
Using the command line, rotation about fractions of degrees are also possible: `rota 2 -10.2` This will rotate the structure around the y axis by -10.2 degrees. 

# Auto Rotation 
This automatically rotates the structure; x rotates the structure from top to bottom, y rotates from left to right and z rotates around in the plane of the page. The speed of rotation can be set using the slider bar. Clicking on a, b or c resets the view to look down the specific axis.
This is maybe not very useful, but can be fun.
