This menu contains some links that help you to get started with Olex2.

# Open a Structure
Olex2 can read many different crystallographic file formats. When  you are working with a crystal structure, the most common way to get into it is by means of opening an ins file. Typically, an hkl file of the same filename would have been created by your data processing software at the same time. If this pair of files is present, you are all set to go.

## Navigate
You can navigate to a file by clicking on the link under the Start tool, or by using File > Open from the menu bar at the top of Olex2.

## Drag and Drop
Alternatively, you can drag and drop any recognised file into Olex2. This file will then be opened, and the current directory will be set to the one where the file was  dragged from.

## Command Line
`reap`, `reap [filename]`

# Sample Structures
We provide some sample structures for you to experiment with. These sample structures are copied into your Olex2 user area on startup. If you delete the them, they will come back in their original state on restart.

## Sucrose
This very simple structure of sucrose (from our coffee room...) is an ideal structure to get started with.

## THPP
An example of a simple disordered structure.

## Co110
A simple transition element complex.

## ZP2
A structure with Z' = 2.

## ZZULI2
A structure that requires 'growing'.

## Water
A metal complex with bound water molecules and one molecule of water of hydration.
