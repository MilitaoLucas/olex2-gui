# Twinning 
These two tools provide a quick way to assess whether twinning is present in your structure. 

## Search for Twin Laws  
This will search for all metrically possible twin laws, and then refine your structure with each of these in turn (if any are found). You can then decide whether any of these give you a better R-factor than an untwinned refinement and then continue with that choice. 

## Cumulative Intensities  
This will generate a graph of the cumulative intensities. If you data follows the bottom line, then your crystal is almost certainly twinned.
