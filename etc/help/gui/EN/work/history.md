# History 
Every step along the process of structure solution and refinement is automatically databased within Olex2 - the 'History'. Click on one of the bars to return to the structure as it was then. 

# History Tree 

Every time a structure is solved, a new history branch is created. Using the drop-down menu, the latest structure stored in the selected branch will automatically be loaded. It is possible to delete and rename branches. To return to an earlier structure solution or different branch of a refinement click on the appropriate structure solution or refinement branch.
