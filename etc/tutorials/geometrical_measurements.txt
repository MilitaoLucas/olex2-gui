p:This tutorial will look at how to get geometrical measurements and analysis from your 3D model using the Olex2 system and the <b>Sample structure THPP</b>.

c:reap 'DataDir()/samples/THPP/THPP.res'
c:spy.revert_to_original()

p:To start with you need to click on the <b>view</b> tab.
h:tab-view
c:spy.switch_tab_for_tutorials(view)

p:You then need to select the tab <b>Geometry</b>.
h:h2-geometry
c:itemstate view-geometry 1

p:In this tab there is 6 different links, each one of these will help to analyse your model and gather data from it, the first one we will look at is <b>Mean Plane(of active selection)</b>

p:In order to use this feature you first need to highlight one of the rings in the strcuture to do this you can hold <b>shift</b> to draw a box over one of the rings or select each atom manually
c:sel C5 N6 C7 C8 C9 C10 

p:Once the structure is highlighted click on the link and the average plane for the structure will be produced on the model, or the command <c>mpln sel</c> can be entered.
c:mpln sel

p:Once the mean plane has been worked out a table containing the results should appear in the text along with the data for the plane normal and the RMSD/A.

p:In order to get rid of the plane it first needs to be selected by clicking on it then you can either press the <b>Delete</b> on your keyboard or you can right click on the plane and choose to eiter hide it or delete it from there.
c:sel TXPlane0
c:kill sel
c:refresh

p:The next function will alllow you to find the best line between the selected options by clicking on <b>Best Line(of active selection)</b>

p:You can either choose to get an overall best line by selecting the entire molecule by holding <b>ctrl+A</b>
c:sel -a
c:line sel

p:The view will now be down the best line of the normal.
c:rota y 90

p:...or you can get one between a minimum of 2 atoms in your structure.
c:sel TXLine0
c:kill sel
c:sel N12 C41
c:line sel

p:This will also view down the best line
c:rota y 90

p:The next function in the tab is <b>Distance and Angles(of selection)</b> which will give the distance and angle of upto 4 atoms in the molcule by selecting them before hand the data will then be displayed in the text in the command window or you could also type the command <c>sel</c> after you have choosen which atoms you would like to measure.
c:sel TXLine0
c:kill sel
c:sel F1 C7 N6 C5
c:sel

p:Then there is the <b>Refine and save esd info</b> which needs to be clicked once in order to use the rest of the functions in the list as this will refine the model and claculate the needed esd information.
c:delins more
c:addins more -3
c:refine

p:The next function, <b>Distance and Angles with esd(of selection)</b> will allow you to view the current esd information of upto 4 atoms, select 4 atoms in the structure.
c:sel N12 C12 C9 C8

p:Then select the link or enter in the command <c>esd</c>
c:esd

p:This will then cause the data to appear in the command window in the software.

p:The next function to be looked at is <b>Analyse &pi;-&pi; Interactions</b> to use this function simply click on the link without highlighting anything
c:pipi -g
c:rota x 90

p:This should have duplicated the molecules to show ring interaction and given some data in the command window
c:fuse

p:Another command you could also use would be the <c>htab</c> command

p:If the command <c>htab</c> is entered into the command line then this will add in found hydrogen bonds to the list for the refinement programme to add to the CIF file.

p:The next command would not work on the currently loaded molecule so the model for <b>Sucrose</b> will be loaded in order to show an example of the command working.
c:reap 'DataDir()/samples/Sucrose/Sucrose.res'
c:spy.revert_to_original()

p:You can also cause the molecules to grow and show hydrogen bond interations between molecules by typing in the command <c>htab -g</c>
c:htab -g

p:There is also another <b>htab</b> command that can be used which is <c>htab -t</b>  which will allow you to attatch unconventional hydrogen bonds to atoms for example if the command was <b>htab -t=Br,I</b> this would cause the Br to gain a bond with I
